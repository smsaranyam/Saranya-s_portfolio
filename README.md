# Project 1: Movie Recommendation System Model (https://github.com/smsaranyam/Movie-Recommendation-System-)

This is a project I did for my masters research paper, where I build a recommendation system for a movies dataset.

Data was taken from the movielens dataset
The model uses both; content-based filtering techniques and collaborative filtering techniques.
Algorithms Used : K-Nearest Neightbours, TF-IDFS, Singular Value Decomposition Model (SVD), Alternatining least Square (ALS)
Optimised the SVD & ALS model.
The Project Write-up is published on SSRN
