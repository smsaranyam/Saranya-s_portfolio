# Project 1: Movie Recommendation System Model (https://github.com/smsaranyam/Movie-Recommendation-System-)

This is a project I did for my masters research paper, where I build a recommendation system for a movies dataset.

Data was taken from the movielens dataset
The model uses both; content-based filtering techniques and collaborative filtering techniques.
Algorithms Used : K-Nearest Neightbours, TF-IDFS, Singular Value Decomposition Model (SVD), Alternatining least Square (ALS)
Optimised the SVD & ALS model.
The Project Write-up is published on SSRN

# Project 2: Amazon Price Scrapper (https://github.com/smsaranyam/BlackFriday_pythonScrapper)
This was part of a personal project where a python price scrapper was built in order to track prices for specific items on amazon and then send out email alerts. The way the model works is you add a link to the amazon product and the price youâ€™re willing to buy the product at (Target Price) and then you can run the script and it will refresh the script every 24 hours and check the price for the product, as soon as the price of the product reaches your target price the scrapper will send you an email alert.

I have also done an entire walkthrough video on youtube for the amazon price scapper and how you can build one too. Click Here For Youtube Video.
